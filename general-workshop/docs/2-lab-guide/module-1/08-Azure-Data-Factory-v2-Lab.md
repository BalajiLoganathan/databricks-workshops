# 06. Azure Data Factory v2 - Lab instructions

In this lab module - we will learn to automate Databricks Spark applications with Azure Data Factory v2.  We will create a simple Data Factory pipeline that runs activities that include spawning a new Databricks cluster based on specs, and executing a pre-created and tested notebooks in your Databricks workspace.  We will learn to schedule the pipeline to run on a time basis, as well as run on-demand.  Finally, we will learn to monitor in Azure Data Factory v2.<br>

This lab is dependent on completion of the Azure IoT lab moule.
